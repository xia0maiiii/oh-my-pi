## Auto-Learn (experimental)

You can grow a library of reusable **managed skills** with the `manage_skill` tool. Managed skills are `SKILL.md` files kept in an isolated directory (`~/.omp/agent/managed-skills`); they are surfaced to you in future sessions like any other skill.

- Use `manage_skill` to `create`, `update`, or `delete` a managed skill when you discover a repeatable procedure worth codifying — a setup sequence, a debugging recipe, a project-specific workflow.
- **Isolation rule:** managed skills are the ONLY skills you may write. NEVER edit user-authored skills under `~/.omp/agent/skills` or `.omp/skills`.
- Capture sparingly and specifically. A skill earns its place only if it will be reused; prefer enhancing an existing managed skill over creating a near-duplicate.
