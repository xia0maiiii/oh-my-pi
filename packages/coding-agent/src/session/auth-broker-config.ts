/**
 * Resolve auth-broker connection configuration for the local omp client.
 *
 * This is a thin coding-agent wrapper around the shared resolver in
 * `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/auth-broker/discover` that preserves the process-lifetime
 * memoization expected by the CLI and injects the full `resolveConfigValue`
 * (including `!command` config indirection) from coding-agent's config layer.
 *
 * Precedence (highest first):
 *   1. `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_URL` / `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_TOKEN` env vars.
 *   2. `auth.broker.url` / `auth.broker.token` in `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`
 *      (hidden from the settings UI; `!command` resolution supported).
 *   3. Token file `~/.omp/auth-broker.token` (paired with URL from env or config).
 *
 * Returns null when no broker URL is configured — caller falls back to the
 * local SQLite store.
 *
 * Reads config.yml directly (instead of going through `Settings.init`) because
 * `discoverAuthStorage` runs before the settings singleton is initialized in
 * `runRootCommand`, and we want hand-edited config entries to be honoured at
 * boot without forcing a startup reorder.
