/**
 * Regression for JS/tab eval workers always stalling until the init timeout.
 *
 * The self-dispatching CLI host imports each worker module dynamically from its
 * argv dispatch, so the worker's own `parentPort.on("message")` attaches after
 * Bun flushes the messages the parent posted before spawn — the synchronously
 * posted `init` handshake was dropped and every run waited out the init timeout
 * before silently falling back to the inline worker. `installWorkerInbox`
 * attaches a `message` listener synchronously in the entry's sync prefix and
 * buffers until the worker module `bind`s the real handler; these tests pin that
 * buffer-replay contract.
