# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `readOnly` flags to participant and session payload types to indicate when a guest is connected via a read-only (view) link
- Added `writeToken` to `GuestFrame` hello payloads and parsed collaboration links so full-access links can carry and expose a write-capability token
- Added `ROOM_KEY_BYTES` and `WRITE_TOKEN_BYTES` constants for room key and write-token sizing in the wire protocol
- Added `DEFAULT_SHARE_URL` (`https://my.omp.sh/s`), the default share viewer/upload base for `/share` links
- Added shared collab live-session wire contracts for the host CLI and browser guest client.

### Changed

- Changed `WireModel.contextWindow` and `ContextUsage.contextWindow` to `number | null` to allow representing unavailable context-window values
