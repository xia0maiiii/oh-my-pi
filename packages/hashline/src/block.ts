/**
 * Expand deferred block edits (`replace_block N:` / `delete_block N` /

 * The hashline parser cannot expand a block edit on its own — the line span is
 * unknown until file text + path (→ language) are available. This transform
 * runs at every apply/preview boundary that has text: it calls the injected
 * {@link BlockResolver} to resolve each block's `[start, end]` span, then emits
 * the exact same edits the concrete form produces in the parser: `replace
 * start.=end:` inserts + deletes for a replace, a pure range delete for a
 * delete, and plain `after_anchor` inserts at `end` for an insert-after. After
 * it runs, no `block` edits remain, so {@link applyEdits} (and recovery) only
 * ever see resolved edits.
