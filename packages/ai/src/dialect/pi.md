## Format guide

A tool call begins with `§` immediately followed by the function NAME (start each call on its own line). Scalar arguments follow on the same line as `key=value` pairs; a single large or multi-line string argument goes in a verbatim body fenced by `«…»` right after the header.

Scalar-only call (the line ends the call):

```text
§read path=src/a.ts offset=50 limit=200
```

Call with a verbatim body — everything between `«` and `»` is taken literally, no quoting or escaping:

```text
§edit path=src/server/auth.ts«
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: src/server/auth.ts
@@ class AuthService
-  login(user) {
+  async login(user, opts) {
*** End Patch
»
```

Argument values:

- Strings are written bare and verbatim (`path=src/a.ts`). Quote with `"…"` only when the value contains spaces or starts with `"`, `[`, or `{` (`i="run the tests"`).
- Numbers, booleans, and `null` are JSON literals (`offset=50`, `force=true`).
- Arrays and objects are inline JSON (`paths=["src","test"]`).
- The body fence holds the call's first long/multi-line string parameter; its key is implied, never written.

Private reasoning goes in a `¤…¤` block before your calls:

```text
¤
brief reasoning
¤
```

Tool results arrive in `‡‡…‡‡` blocks, read in call order:

```text
‡‡
verbatim tool result
‡‡
```

## Rules

- `NAME` MUST match a listed function; never wrap calls in JSON or fences.
- Put each scalar argument once as `key=value`; reserve the `«…»` body for the one dominant string argument (file contents, patches, commands, queries).
- Body text is verbatim — include no surrounding quotes. If the body itself contains `»`, widen BOTH guillemet fences equally (`««…»»`, `«««…»»»`).
- Emit parallel calls as consecutive `§…` blocks. NEVER invent call ids; results are positional.
- Private reasoning goes in a `¤…¤` block before your calls; NEVER put calls inside it, and keep a literal `¤` out of the reasoning text.
- Read each `‡‡…‡‡` result in call order. NEVER emit a `‡‡` block yourself.
- After emitting your tool calls, YOU MUST EMIT THE STOP SEQUENCE AND HALT.
