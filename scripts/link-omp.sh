# Install the dev `omp` wrapper into Bun's global bin directory.
#
# Replaces the bun-shebang symlink that `bun --cwd=packages/coding-agent link`
# creates (pointing at `src/cli.ts`) with the safer wrapper at
# `packages/coding-agent/scripts/omp`. See that wrapper's header comment for the
# bunfig.toml-preload bug it works around.
#
# We resolve Bun's global bin path defensively because `bun pm -g bin` aborts
# (`No package.json was found for directory "$HOME/.bun/install/global"`) on
# fresh hosts where the global install has not been initialized. Falling
# through that error would expand `$(bun pm -g bin)/omp` to `/omp` and try to
# write under `/` — see https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/3701.
